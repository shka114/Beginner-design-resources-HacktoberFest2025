# üñåÔ∏è Figma Tutorial for Beginners

This tutorial introduces the basics of Figma, a popular web-based design tool used for UI/UX design, wireframing, and prototyping.

---

## 1. Getting Started

1. Go to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and sign up (free plan is enough for beginners).  
2. Once logged in, you can either:
   - Create a **New File** for a blank canvas.
   - Open an existing Figma file or template.

---

## 2. Creating Frames

Frames in Figma act like artboards in other design tools. They help structure your design and organize elements.

1. Select the **Frame Tool** (`F`) from the toolbar.
2. Click and drag on the canvas to create a frame of any size.
3. You can also choose **preset device sizes** (like iPhone, Desktop) from the right-hand panel.
4. Frames can contain other elements like shapes, text, and images.

üí° Tip: Use frames to define screens for your app or sections of a webpage.

## 3. Adding Elements

- **Shapes:** Press `R` for rectangle, `O` for ellipse, or use the shape tools in the toolbar.
- **Text:** Press `T` to add text boxes.
- **Images:** Drag and drop images or use `Place Image` (`Shift+Ctrl+K` / `Shift+Cmd+K`).

## 4. Creating Components

Components are reusable design elements, like buttons or icons.

1. Select the element or group of elements you want to reuse.
2. Right-click and choose **Create Component** or press `Ctrl+Alt+K` / `Cmd+Option+K`.
3. The component will appear in the **Assets panel** and can be reused multiple times.
4. Any updates to the main component will automatically update all instances.

üí° Example: Create a primary button as a component so all buttons in your design stay consistent.

## 5. Prototyping

Prototyping allows you to simulate how your app or website will behave.

1. Switch to the **Prototype** tab in the right-hand panel.
2. Select an element (like a button) and drag the **blue node** to the frame you want to link to.
3. Set interaction details:
   - **Trigger:** On Click, On Hover, etc.
   - **Action:** Navigate To, Open Overlay, Scroll, etc.
4. Click **Present** (`Play` icon) in the top-right to test your prototype.

üí° Tip: Use prototyping to show the flow between app screens or webpage sections.
